# Tabler QIcon

Tabler QIcon is a Python package that provides easy access to [Tabler Icons](https://tabler-icons.io/) [[GitHub]](https://github.com/tabler/tabler-icons) for PyQt and PySide applications. It uses SVGs from Tabler Icons and converts them into QIcon objects, which can be used in PyQt and PySide applications.

This library also supports icon customization such as changing color, size, view box size, stroke width, and opacity.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or later
- PyQt5, PyQt6, PySide2, or PySide6

## Installation

**Note**: The `tabler-qicon` package is not currently available on PyPI. However, you can still install it directly from its GitHub repository using the following command:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/promto-c/tabler-qicon.git
```

If you are using a PyQt5 backend, you must also install PyQt5:

```bash
pip install PyQt5
```

## Usage

Create an instance of `TablerQIcon` and set the properties by passing arguments during instantiation. Then, retrieve an icon as follows:

```python
from PyQt5 import QtGui
from tabler_qicon import TablerQIcon

tabler = TablerQIcon(color=QtGui.QColor(255, 0, 0))  # Set color to red during instantiation
icon = tabler.users  # This icon will be colored red

# WIP: Add more example usages
```

All properties (color, size, view_box_size, stroke_width, and opacity) can be set when creating an instance of `TablerQIcon`. If these are not specified, default values will be used.

## Development

Run the tests:

```bash
pytest tests
```
